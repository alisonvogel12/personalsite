                                I <strong>LOVE</strong> to volunteer! I am very civic-minded and enjoy helping others.
                                I have been very fortunate in life and love the chance to help someone else gain some needed help or encouragement in their own life.
                                Two of the organizations I am most passionate about are the Junior League of Louisville and Boys and Girls Haven of Louisville.
                                I am very involved with projects, fundraisers, committees, and event planning for both of these organizations.
                                I have been a member of Junior League of Louisville since January 2013 and a member of the Boys and Girls Haven Advisory Board since fall 2014.
